**Biomedical Ethics Class**
Ethics is a subject where most people think they will just intuitively know the difference between right and wrong. My biomedical ethics class quickly proved that concept wrong. We tackled many different topics with stories and logical opinions from people on both sides of an issue. We tackled classic problems like the trolly problem and some of it’s many different iterations to whether their is ethical difference between Physican Assisted Suicide and Death with Dignity and whether either are ever permissible. When it comes to ethics, biomedical ethics is often the most divisive and emotionally fraught topic as it can have to do with life and death. This was a class I would find myself thinking about when doing chores or bringing up in conversations with people whose opinions I valued highly. This class made me think because we were always provided with both sides of the story and sometimes it could be hard to tell what was the right decision. Our ethics are a core part of who we are so it’s especially hard and thought provoking when we are presented with a question that isn’t immediately clear to us what we should do. I found it fascinating to hear everyone’s different perspectives and ways of thinking of a problem in this class and it was a fabulous introduction to the ethics I would cover in my time at DU.

**Ethics Bootcamp**
While I had dual enrollment credit for DU’s Legal studies class I attended the Ethics bootcamp that is mandatory as part of that class. In this experience I heard many of DU’s law professors speak on ethical dilemmas. They discussed how abandoning your ethics in a professional setting could land you in jail, how “just this once” almost never remains at just that once, and how our ethics are critical to who we are as a person. Professor Ciocchetti of the Business Ethics and Legal Studies department gave us a speech on why ethics matters that I thought was well said. He talked about why we should do the right thing even when no one is looking. One of his most insightful stories was about how who puts away shopping carts after using them can truly tell you a lot about them as a person. No one ever rewards you for putting away a shopping cart you do it because it’s the right thing to do. I think this notion is especially interesting because during my travels to other countries there are some places where you must input a coin to get a shopping cart and you only get the coin back when you return the cart. While this says quite clearly that not everyone does the right thing for the sake of it being the right thing, most people do. I found Dr. Ciocchetti’s speech really impactful because it put into words why we as humans do the right thing when there is no clear gain to us. It’s important to me to contribute to the world by being someone who does the right thing just because it’s right.



## Global/Intercultural Competence
**Growing up in a small mountain town:**
Coming from a small mountain town I found a different type of diversity at DU than I’d ever experienced before. Growing up in Durango, there were unexpected areas of diversity. I had a piano teacher who was of Japanese descent and was also Mormon. There was an Amish community on the outskirts of our town. We also had a Catholic K-8 school. I got to know many people of different religious backgrounds. Going to public school in Durango also forced you to become familiar with people who had backgrounds different from your own. In class there would be people from town and people from the rural surrounding areas. In one of my classes one of my peers missed a test because she was helping her goat give birth. We would have lots of different political views, religious views, and geographical backgrounds all in one classroom. Everyone had to get along somewhat though because the classes were so small. One of my peers' mother was my haircutter, another peer's mother taught me to ride horses, and yet another peer’s mom was my mom’s doctor. Because everyone knew each other we all got along fairly well despite our differences. I believe that growing up in this type of setting set me up well to further embrace diversity in my college experience. From a young age I learned that different backgrounds and experiences could influence us to have different viewpoints. These views almost always had logic behind them if people sat down and had a discussion. These different viewpoints were a strength because other people would bring up points we hadn’t even considered but were obvious to them given their background. 

**Expanding my experience with diversity in college:**
While the small town I grew up in had lots of diversity in some ways it also lacked some forms of diversity. I was exposed to very little racial diversity growing up and most everyone I met had been born in the US. When I moved up to DU I became friends with someone whose parents had immigrated from India after an arranged marriage. While this background was very different from mine I was honored to be welcomed by her family. Her mother took the time to teach me and some of our other friends how to cook Indian dishes. She even gifted us with some spices from her cabinet from India. When Ramadan came around  one of their family friends gave us Henna. Having her family be so kind and welcoming had a big impact on me. I was able to discuss with her parts of her background and what she agreed with and didn’t agree with which was deeply insightful for me. Being welcomed by her as well as other friends into their cultures helped me not only understand them better but also understand my view of the world better. Seeing the way others live their life and their values can help guide your own.

**Study Abroad Experience in Oxford**
Between my Sophomore and Junior year I chose to spend the summer studying abroad at Oxford. Coming from a town where the nearest city with over 50,000 people was 3.5 hours away and in a different state to landing at London Heathrow, the main base for London, a city with 9 million, was intimidating to say the least. Add to that that I needed to use public transportation to reach Oxford, something that was virtually nonexistent in my home town, and I knew I would need to be adaptable. I came over time to be proficient enough at using public transportation that I used it to travel to Paris a week before the 2024 Olympics. I was able to adapt to the large cities that were conveniently located nearby. While I believe that adaptation to other cultures is important to keeping an open mind, one of the most interesting things about my time at Oxford was the teaching style.
I had the full Oxford experience in that we were taught in small dialogue focused classrooms. My class was my Oxford professor as well as two other students. We would come to class having read the necessary material and with our basic thoughts and sometimes a presentation on the material and then we would spend class discussing. I learned that that method of teaching had been around for centuries. Getting to experience this different format of teaching had its benefits and drawbacks. At Oxford I learned a lot about the history of Great Britain and France which I was able to weave into the history that the US is based on as well. Being able to see how their culture had influenced the country in which I grew up and where we had strayed from their legal systems and government setup said a lot to me about the US.


**Summer experience at Deloitte:**
After continuing to learn more about different cultures and backgrounds through my college experience I was able to apply these learnings in a work setting during my 2025 summer internship at Deloitte. I was privileged enough to be able to work on a very global team.While this presented the typical workplace challenges of colleagues being in different places like trying to find a time to schedule a zoom call it also sparked additional learning. We were able to connect and learn about each other during work. I learned that people in Bern Switzerland will sometimes float down the river from work to home as a means of transportation. Our moments of connection required grace on both of our parts. Instead of a spelling error in an email meaning someone didn’t take the time to double check their email it was often simply do to the language the email was written in being in a secondary language. Sometimes emails were forwarded to me in another language but my colleague would take the time to give me a short summary of the important points in English at the top. Working together took thinking ahead about other’s primary languages and time zones and offering each other understanding. It also allowed us to bring more opinions to the table which was helpful in making the best decisions.
