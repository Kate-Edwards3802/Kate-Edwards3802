# Growing up in a small mountain town:
Coming from a small mountain town I found a different type of diversity at DU than I’d ever experienced before. Growing up in Durango, there were unexpected areas of diversity. I had a piano teacher who was of Japanese descent and was also Mormon. There was an Amish community on the outskirts of our town. We also had a Catholic K-8 school. I got to know many people of different religious backgrounds. Going to public school in Durango also forced you to become familiar with people who had backgrounds different from your own. In class there would be people from town and people from the rural surrounding areas. In one of my classes one of my peers missed a test because she was helping her goat give birth. We would have lots of different political views, religious views, and geographical backgrounds all in one classroom. Everyone had to get along somewhat though because the classes were so small. One of my peers' mother was my haircutter, another peer's mother taught me to ride horses, and yet another peer’s mom was my mom’s doctor. Because everyone knew each other we all got along fairly well despite our differences. I believe that growing up in this type of setting set me up well to further embrace diversity in my college experience. From a young age I learned that different backgrounds and experiences could influence us to have different viewpoints. These views almost always had logic behind them if people sat down and had a discussion. These different viewpoints were a strength because other people would bring up points we hadn’t even considered but were obvious to them given their background. 

# Expanding my experience with diversity in college:
While the small town I grew up in had lots of diversity in some ways it also lacked some forms of diversity. I was exposed to very little racial diversity growing up and most everyone I met had been born in the US. When I moved up to DU I became friends with someone whose parents had immigrated from India after an arranged marriage. While this background was very different from mine I was honored to be welcomed by her family. Her mother took the time to teach me and some of our other friends how to cook Indian dishes. She even gifted us with some spices from her cabinet from India. When Ramadan came around  one of their family friends gave us Henna. Having her family be so kind and welcoming had a big impact on me. I was able to discuss with her parts of her background and what she agreed with and didn’t agree with which was deeply insightful for me. Being welcomed by her as well as other friends into their cultures helped me not only understand them better but also understand my view of the world better. Seeing the way others live their life and their values can help guide your own.

# Study Abroad Experience in Oxford
Between my Sophomore and Junior year I chose to spend the summer studying abroad at Oxford. Coming from a town where the nearest city with over 50,000 people was 3.5 hours away and in a different state to landing at London Heathrow, the main base for London, a city with 9 million, was intimidating to say the least. Add to that that I needed to use public transportation to reach Oxford, something that was virtually nonexistent in my home town, and I knew I would need to be adaptable. I came over time to be proficient enough at using public transportation that I used it to travel to Paris a week before the 2024 Olympics. I was able to adapt to the large cities that were conveniently located nearby. While I believe that adaptation to other cultures is important to keeping an open mind, one of the most interesting things about my time at Oxford was the teaching style.
I had the full Oxford experience in that we were taught in small dialogue focused classrooms. My class was my Oxford professor as well as two other students. We would come to class having read the necessary material and with our basic thoughts and sometimes a presentation on the material and then we would spend class discussing. I learned that that method of teaching had been around for centuries. Getting to experience this different format of teaching had its benefits and drawbacks. At Oxford I learned a lot about the history of Great Britain and France which I was able to weave into the history that the US is based on as well. Being able to see how their culture had influenced the country in which I grew up and where we had strayed from their legal systems and government setup said a lot to me about the US.


# Summer experience at Deloitte:
After continuing to learn more about different cultures and backgrounds through my college experience I was able to apply these learnings in a work setting during my 2025 summer internship at Deloitte. I was privileged enough to be able to work on a very global team.While this presented the typical workplace challenges of colleagues being in different places like trying to find a time to schedule a zoom call it also sparked additional learning. We were able to connect and learn about each other during work. I learned that people in Bern Switzerland will sometimes float down the river from work to home as a means of transportation. Our moments of connection required grace on both of our parts. Instead of a spelling error in an email meaning someone didn’t take the time to double check their email it was often simply do to the language the email was written in being in a secondary language. Sometimes emails were forwarded to me in another language but my colleague would take the time to give me a short summary of the important points in English at the top. Working together took thinking ahead about other’s primary languages and time zones and offering each other understanding. It also allowed us to bring more opinions to the table which was helpful in making the best decisions.
